## Go PDX Meeting

### Tools online for community

* Gophers #portland
* freenode #pdxgo
* googlegroup #pdxgo
* Google doc for conversations: is.gd/pdxgorqa
* golang dev for go development (not pdx)

### Next Events

* Winder Coder Social December 15th
* GoBridge in December

### Edward Mullerâ€™s talk (by @freeformz, works at Heroku)

*[Code and Slides](https://github.com/freeformz/talks/tree/master/20151110_pdxgo)*

* internal log delivery: log-shuttle
* experimental heroku cli in go: hk

#### tools he mentioned

* godep
  * what to expect from the changes on standard library on vendoring
* errcheck: https://github.com/kisielk/errcheck

#### project management

* everything non-standard goes in makefile
* use -X main.<name>=<value> for injection: they use it for commmit revision at compile time

##### coding practice: structure

* cmd/$CMD/main.go pattern
* balanced packages

#### Channels

* struct{} vs bool channels: He recommends a struct (because true/false does not mean anything to the receiver).
* broadcast with close()

#### coding practices: initialization

* avoid init()
  * avoid init for globals
* handle env vars in mains


#### coding practices: http

* close http.response.body(http.client). if the http.response does not have a body then it is a bug. It is quite important to close this http.response.body!
* use github.com/tylerb/graceful
* prefer stdlib compatible libraries vs. magic


#### coding practices: error handling

* create error types!! : put them in a different file (not in different package)
  * recommendations to look on how net.dial handles errors (https://golang.org/pkg/net/)
  * look at https://github.com/juju/errors
* annotate errors (comment on what the error means)
* each go routines must handle their own recover process
* try to do rollbar (or equivalent) in production

#### coding practices: testing

* try to stay with standar library (he recommends gocheck but it adds a little overhead)
* if you do use table tests, include identifyin information <----- LOOK AT TABLE TESTS
* Use ci (travis/circle)
* Test with -race and w/o

* Mocking: use interfaces!! even if you only use it internally (even if you don't expose them)


#### Common libraries

* envdecode
* go-metrics
* uuid: a copy from the one on code.google.com
* logrus: he recommends that one. it has hooks, it does structure logging (logfmt)
* rollbar or rollrus
* errors
* fernet-go
* htcat
* toml: for configuration files!!!
* graceful
* awk-sdk-go


#### Debatables

* assertion /testing libraries
  * he says are not needed because testing from standard library is complete
* logging libraries
