- voz data story
  - the problem
      - la nacion had 5 years of scanned data on senate's expenses
      - too dirty for OCR
      - information that readers care about
      - la nacion needed the data in a procesable format to be able to analysis it.
  - the solution
      - started by Manuel Aristaran when he was a fellow at La Nacion the year before
      - it provides a platform for readers to browse the information and assess which one may be important to the journalists
      - transform all data into CSV
  - inspiration
      - not a new idea but inspired in what other newsrooms have been doing in a very customized way
      - our platform is installable for anyone that may want to do this.
      - our platform is configurable for multiple projects
      - now la nacion is also using it for audio files
- coral project
  - the problem
      - comments are toxic and newsroom have problems with moderation
      - newsrooms are "outsourcing" comments to social media, losing control over data that can benefit on how they are making journalism
  - one solution
      - started by a collaboration between new york times and washington post with the support of mozilla foundation and a 2 years grant from the knight foundation
      - an open source tool that can be installed in your own server
      - it can be embedded in any article that you want to have comments in
      - an open source form builder that can help you organize a call for readers to help on something
      - guides on community in journalism

- tactical tech collective
    - work with journalists & human right defenders
    - guides on data, foia, privacy, security
