## How did I get here?

- Computer science's student when WTO's protests in Seattle happened.
- Free software movement.
- Internet was the promise of participatory media.
- The "media" does not represent us.

- Started as a participatory design project in Los Angeles, California.
- It allowed immigrant and low wages workers in LA to document their own stories (via any phone)
- Drupal based platform that captures and format media sent by phone.

## The problem

  - La nacion had 5 years of scanned data on senate's expenses.
  - Files were too dirty for OCR to scan them.
  - Information that readers care about.
  - La Nacion needed the data in a procesable format to be able to analyze it.


## The solution

  - Started by Manuel Aristaran when he was a fellow at La Nacion the year before me.
  - It provides a platform for readers to browse the information and assess which one may be important to the journalists.
  - Transform all data into CSV.


## Inspiration

  - Not a new idea but inspired on what other newsrooms have been doing.
  - Our platform is installable for anyone that may want to do this.
  - Our platform is configurable for multiple projects.
  - Now la nacion is also using it for audio files.

## Some problems

  - Comments are toxic and newsrooms have problems moderating them.
  - Newsrooms are "outsourcing" comments to social media, losing control over data that can benefit on how they are making journalism.
  - There is a lack of diversity and representation of marginalized voices in media.


## Collaboration

  - Started as a collaboration between New York Times and Washington Post with the support of Mozilla Foundation and a 2 years grant from the Knight Foundation.


## Tools and Guides

  - An open source tool that can be installed in your own server.
  - It can be embedded in any article that you want to have comments in.
  - An open source form builder that can help you organize a call for readers to help on something.
  - Guides on community in journalism.
